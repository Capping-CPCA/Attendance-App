Attendance-App for Capping 2017
============================================
The attendance application has two versions: A desktop app and an online app.

The desktop app is used by students to enter attendance information electronically at the beginning of class. The application is a java executable file which allows attendance information to be saved to the local directory of the computer.

The online app is used by staff to enter attendance information electronically after class has been completed. The staff member must simply select students who were present in class and the application will save the information to the online database.

For any questions in the future, you can contact Colby Gray (colby.gray1@marist.edu) or Chris Algozzine (christopher.algozzine1@marist.edu).
